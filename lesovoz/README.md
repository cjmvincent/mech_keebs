# Lesovoz

Lesovoz is a 4x10 ortholinear split-cluster through-hole PCB to be slotted into a MiniVan case. My Lesovoz has been dropped into a basic clear acrylic case, and built with KAM SuperUser keycaps and LTC Jerrzi Tactile Switches. The spring in these switches have been swapped for 63.5g springs because I type too hard.

Coupled with this keeb is a Keychron Q0 wireless numpad. While I do have a numpad layer on all of my keyboards I keep this dedicated numpad/macropad with my main keyboard for instances creating and editing lots of network configurations as a network engineer.
