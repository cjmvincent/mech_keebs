# BallzOut

BallzOut is a prototype 40% keyboard with trackball designed and built by /u/ProtieusKeebs. This is a one-of-a-kind keyboard that was gifted to me by Protieus for helping him fund the project. This board has a sister that has an integrated trackpad opposed to a trackball for a pointer device.
