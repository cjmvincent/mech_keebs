# Atreus62

This is the Atreus62 by /u/profet23. This particular build is an acrylic sandwich style case in fluroescent green. It has been paired with Zeal Tealio Linear switches and KAT Cyberspace keycaps.

Coupled with this board is my Owlab Voice Mini. My Voice Mini is the Obsidian colorway equiped with Gateron Luicolo Linear Switches and DOYS Keycaps to match the color scheme of the Atreus62.
